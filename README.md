This is a personal project on sowing sales insights of a company using MySQL and PowerBI. Purpose: To unlock sales insights that are not visible to the sales team for decision support and automate them to reduce manual time spend in data gathering. End Result: An automated dashboard providing quick and latest sales insights to make data-driven decision-making.

## ❓Problem Statement
The sales manager of the company is facing many challenges. He is facing issues in tracking sales in a dynamically growing market. He is having issues with the insights into his business. So, the problem is that the conversations that are happening are verbal. Hence, the regional managers are sugarcoating the facts, and the manager of the company does not get a clear picture of the facts. Even after knowing that the sales are declining, he cannot do anything because he does not have a clear picture of the sales. Asking for the records the regional manager provides him with excel files. But by this, he cannot figure out small things. All that the manager wants is a view of the weakest area the company needs to focus on to increase sales and improvise the declination. He is interested in simple, understandable, and digestive insight
